# Scraping Land Fair Prices from E-government Platform

In this project, street by street land fair prices in several districts of Istanbul have been extracted from e-government platform. In order to automate navigation, selenium library has been used since the platform uses javascript to load all contents. Extracted information has been formed into pandas dataframe in desired format and exported to csv or xlsx files.
